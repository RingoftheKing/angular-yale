        The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic Design,
        Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture;
        and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students.
        Our website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing.
        It functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of Art community have the ability to add new,
        and edit most existing content.
